# emOjis
## Contributing guidelines
Thanks for visiting! Just wanted to note that I can only accept PRs for fixes to typos.
If you have any new ideas / thoughts on gifs, please open an issue first so that we can discuss it. 
Currently we only have 5 emOjis. We will continue working on the new version to make the world a better place. 

## Installation

## Usage
You can use these gifs whatever you like. The most notable usage I have seen so far is using it as a stamp on Slack. 
The following table provides a list of the emOji characters with images, descriptions, and keywords. 
The ordering of the emoji and the annotation are based on the date created. (This might change as we will plan to sort by category)
